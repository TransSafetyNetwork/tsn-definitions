**Contributors**:

Early discussions on this were contributed to by a network of international researchers
who I will name here directly if/when they express a wish to be listed.

Going forward, public contributors will be added to this contributors list.

**Status**: Establishing acceptance criteria.

This is a very early proposal for a standard and the information within is not suitable
for application yet.

**Version History**:

- 0.0.1 - First draft. Developing acceptance criteria.
- 0.0.2 - First public draft. Openness to comment via github issues.

**Summary**:

Public bodies are becoming increasingly technocratic and often inaccessible to the voices
of those being harmed, who lack a technical capability to articulate a clear evidence
based case for even identifying harm to relevant bodies, let alone ending it. It has become
increasingly common for trans* groups to describe organisations committed to harming them
as “hate groups”, but for this to go ignored. While this is at core a result of the
disenfranchisement of affected communities, one aspect of this is lack of evidence or 
clarity on what constitutes a hate group, such that this information can be used by highly
bureaucratic organisations. Further, a default institutional position has arisen that lacks 
comprehension of transphobia necessary to recognise it and respond accordingly. Because of
this, there is a need to create a framework for evidence gathering and identifying clearly 
the characteristics of the organised harms targeting the trans* community, and to make
this available to the affected community, so as to eliminate ambiguities when communicating 
with other bodies.

This document attempts to set out acceptance criteria for a technical classification tool 
for assessing transphobic organising, with a view to helping anti-harm researchers and
members of the trans community communicate risk with public bodies (including but not
limited to the public themselves, the press/media, regulatory bodies, civic institutions,
government and granting organisations).

Provisionally this document defines "trans*" expansively so as to include marginalised 
gender constituencies anywhere in the world, inclusive of a wide range of cultural identities, 
so far as they fall outside of a binary cisgender norm. This is not to colonise these
identities as if they were simply all local translations of the Western Trans concept rather
than culturally distinct, but out of a need to articulate and draw attention to the differing
but nevertheless global oppression faced by these groups, especially in the face of 
colonising efforts at normalising existing global gender diversity into a binary cisgender 
schema. As this document is at early draft stage for acceptance criteria, it is open to
establishing a better international language for addressing this idea.

**Strategic Goals:**

These are high level requirements driving the need for the standard.

1. To reduce harm
2. To create and sustain community norms that help reduce harm.
3. To counter the accelerating effects that organisation and networking of organised harm
does.
4. To establish common ways of describing these forms of organisation both to communicate
within the research community and beyond.
5. To establish a benchmark for scales of risk that is based on evidence gathering based
approaches.

**Anti-goals:**

These are criteria which should prevent release of such a tool for public use.

1. The tool produced by this process MUST NOT replicate naturalisation of institutional
harms - e.g. any such schema should be actively designed AGAINST the existing bias in many
systems to legitimise overpolicing of disenfranchised minority groups while failing to recognise the institution of policing itself as a potential source of harm.
3. This tool MUST NOT be incompatible with intersectional organising or embed in it
hostility towards other intersecting marginalised social groups that might damage wider efforts at global harm reduction.
4. The tool produced MUST NOT contain legalese or highly technical or obscure uses of
language that may be subject to easy misinterpretation.
5. The tool SHOULD NOT embed forms of local understanding which interfere with identifying
trans-national organised harm.

**Goals:**

These are positive requirements that must be fulfilled by the product of this process.

1. To produce a tool for evaluating risk posed by organised harm groups, whether this is
ideological, material or otherwise. An example of an ideological risk is where intellectuals
and harm group leaders rationalise and justify harm to a social group. An example of a
material risk is an instance where harm group members engage in direct hostility towards
members of the group being harmed.
2. That this tool should provide a useful framework to structure and prioritise harm
research and evidence gathering efforts around, in terms of metrics like (but not limited
to) evaluating impact, severity of past activities, severity of intent, resources and
institutional support.
3. This tool should be accessible to, usable by and legible to the general public,
including committing to some appropriate standard for writing such as the Plain English
Campaign guidelines. Translation of such a standard into other languages should attempt
to meet similar standards where they exist.
4. This tool should be compatible, so far as possible, with existing leading definitions
of transphobia already in use by trans* rights organisations.
5. This tool should to the extent possible help facilitate international research
collaboration and comparative assessment, including efforts at joint monitoring of
trans-national harm organisations (such as dark money networks, missionary colonisation
projects and so on).
6. To establish a protocol for gathering feedback and diagnosing issues with the tool
periodically (such as every few years) after release and issuing corrections so that it
continues to be useful over time.
