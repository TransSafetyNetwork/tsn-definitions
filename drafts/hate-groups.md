## Summary

Public bodies are becoming increasingly technocratic and often inaccessible to the voices of those being harmed, who lack a technical capability to articulate a clear evidence based case for even identifying harm to relevant bodies, let alone ending it. It has become increasingly common for trans* groups to describe organisations committed to harming them as “hate groups”, but for this to go ignored. While this is at core a result of the disenfranchisement of affected communities, one aspect of this is lack of evidence or clarity on what constitutes a hate group, such that this information can be used by highly bureaucratic organisations. Further, a default institutional position has arisen that lacks comprehension of transphobia necessary to recognise it and respond accordingly. Because of this, there is a need to create a framework for evidence gathering and identifying clearly the characteristics of the organised harms targeting the trans* community, and to make this available to the affected community, so as to eliminate ambiguities when communicating with other bodies.

This document attempts to set out acceptance criteria for a technical classification tool for assessing transphobic organising, with a view to helping anti-harm researchers and members of the trans community communicate risk with public bodies (including but not limited to the public themselves, the press/media, regulatory bodies, civic institutions, government and granting organisations).

Provisionally this document defines "trans*" expansively so as to include marginalised gender constituencies anywhere in the world, inclusive of a wide range of cultural identities, so far as they fall outside of a binary cisgender norm. This is not to colonise these identities as if they were simply all local translations of the Western Trans concept rather than culturally distinct, but out of a need to articulate and draw attention to the differing but nevertheless global oppression faced by these groups, especially in the face of colonising efforts at normalising existing global gender diversity into a binary cisgender schema. As this document is at early draft stage for acceptance criteria, it is open to establishing a better international language for addressing this idea.

## Strategic Goals

These are high level requirements driving the need for the standard.

1. To reduce harm
1. To create and sustain community norms that help reduce harm.
1. To counter the accelerating effects that organisation and networking of organised harm does.
1. To establish common ways of describing these forms of organisation both to communicate within the research community and beyond.
1. To establish a benchmark for scales of risk that is based on evidence gathering based approaches.

## Anti-goals

These are criteria which should prevent release of such a tool for public use.

1. The tool produced by this process MUST NOT replicate naturalisation of institutional harms. Any such schema should be actively designed AGAINST the existing bias in many systems to legitimise overpolicing of disenfranchised minority groups while failing to recognise the institution of policing itself as a potential source of harm.
1. This tool MUST be compatible with intersectional organising, and therefore not embed in it hostility towards other intersecting marginalised social groups that might damage wider efforts at global harm reduction.
2. The tool produced SHOULD attempt to reduce remove legalese and technical or obscure uses of language that may be subject to easy misinterpretation.
3. The tool SHOULD NOT embed forms of local understanding which interfere with identifying trans-national organised harm.

## Goals

These are positive requirements that must be fulfilled by the product of this process.

1. To produce a tool for evaluating risk posed by organised harm groups, whether this is ideological, material or otherwise. 
   1. An example of an ideological risk is where intellectuals and harm group leaders rationalise and justify harm to a social group. 
   2. An example of a material risk is an instance where harm group members engage in direct hostility towards members of the group being harmed.
2. The tool should provide a useful framework to structure and prioritise harm research and evidence gathering efforts around, in terms of metrics like (but not limited to) evaluating impact, severity of past activities, severity of intent, resources and institutional support.
3. The tool should be accessible to, usable by and legible to the general public, including committing to some appropriate standard for writing such as the Plain English Campaign guidelines. Translation of such a standard into other languages should attempt to meet similar standards where they exist.
4. The tool should be compatible, so far as possible, with existing leading definitions of transphobia already in use by trans* rights organisations.
5. The tool should to the extent possible help facilitate international research collaboration and comparative assessment, including efforts at joint monitoring of trans-national harm organisations such as dark money networks, missionary colonisation projects and so on.
6. To establish a protocol for regularly gathering feedback and diagnosing issues with the tool and issuing corrections so that it continues to be useful over time.
